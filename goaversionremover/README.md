# GoaVersionRemover Plugin

The `goaversionremover` plugin is a [Goa v3](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/tree/v3) plugin
that removes the Goa version in the header of generated files.

## Enabling the Plugin

To enable the plugin simply import as follows:

```go
import (
  _ "github.com/tchssk/goaplugins/v3/goaversionremover"
  . "goa.design/goa/v3/dsl"
)
```

## Effects on Code Generation

Enabling the plugin changes the behavior of the `gen` command of the `goa` tool.

The `gen` command output is modified as follows:

1. All headers in the generated files are modified to not contain the Goa version. 

    ```diff
    -	// Code generated by goa v3.14.4, DO NOT EDIT.
    +	// Code generated by goa, DO NOT EDIT.
    ```
